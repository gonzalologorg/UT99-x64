# x64 Port WIP

> This is a fork in order to learn to port a program into x64

## It's not functional!
- I have no idea what i'm doing
- I don't know if i ever will success on it
- I'm kinda vibecoding it (To bold first 2 points)

But my main goal is to be able to compile it so i can run it on Pico4, so this is not really for x64 but Android -> VR
I hope to be able to get it done, I really wanna play (After enjoying cs 1.6 vr) UnrealTournament, along ut2004, those are **MY FAVORITE** games, so let's hope everything goes well

** UPDATE
It's booting, at awful perfomance and with graphical issues, but MAN, it's ALIVE! Still no audio yet

## 

**Unreal Tournament Android** is an Android port of **Unreal Tournament / UT99 (1999)** based on the classic **Unreal Engine 1** source code.

> [!NOTE]
> Unofficial fan port.
> No game data included.
> Requires legally obtained Unreal Tournament v1.400 game files.
> This project is not official and is not endorsed by Epic Games.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This app is 32 bit only!** It won't install on your phone? Then it might only accept 64 bit apps. 
> There are no plans on making this app compatible with 64 bit only CPUs. 
> 
> Video games on smartphones are great, but not user-friendly if they require more than two thumbs to control. For this reason, this port is designed for controller input and does only offer basic touchscreen controls.
>
> This project is for preservation, experimentation and personal use only.  
> Unreal Tournament, Unreal Engine and related trademarks are owned by Epic Games.  
> This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Epic Games.

## ◈ Features

- Android support for newer Android devices up to Android 13 (no 64 bit devices).
- OUYA (Android 4.x) legacy support - with a lower internal render resolution for better performance on legacy hardware.
- Improved Game Data Import – Unreal Tournament data can be imported via folder or ZIP selection and automatically installs to the app's data folder.
- Android 8+ Storage Access Fixed – SAF support added for modern Android versions where direct SD/file access is restricted.
- Legacy storage behavior friendly for old sideload devices (place game data on your microSD/UT99 folder).
- Local WiFi multiplayer and botmatches are available.
- Added touch controls for use without a controller.

> [!NOTE]
> Expect occasional issues, especially on very old Android devices or unusual controller mappings.

## ▣ Requirements

- Android device with OpenGL ES 2.0 support.
- Android 4.1 / API 16 or newer.
- ARMv7 compatible device for the current build.
- Android-compatible game controller recommended.
- Original Unreal Tournament / UT99 [PC game data v400](https://archive.org/download/ut-99_202512/UT99.iso).

Required game data folders:

```text
UnrealTournament/
├── System/
├── Maps/
├── Textures/
├── Sounds/
└── Music/
```

The installer accepts the folders either directly at the selected root or inside one top-level Unreal Tournament folder.

---

## ◎ Installation

1. Install the APK on your Android device.
2. Copy your Unreal Tournament game data to your device, either:
   - as an extracted folder, or
   - as a ZIP file.
3. Start **Unreal Tournament**.
4. If no game data is found, the installer screen appears.
5. Choose one of the following:
   - **Select UT99 folder**
   - **Select UT99 ZIP**
6. Wait until the import is finished.
7. The game starts automatically once the required data is found.

The app installs the game data into its private Android data folder.

## ◇ Default controller layout

The default controller mapping is designed for Android gamepads, OUYA and handheld devices such as Retroid-style controllers.

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Left Stick | Move forward / backward / strafe |
| Right Stick | Look / turn |
| Left Trigger | Alternate Fire |
| Right Trigger | Fire |
| Left Shoulder | Previous Weapon |
| Right Shoulder | Next Weapon |
| A / right face button | Jump |
| B / bottom face button / OUYA O | Crouch |
| Y / left face button / OUYA U | Walk |
| X / top face button / OUYA Y | Wave |
| D-Pad | Menu navigation / in-game navigation depending on context |
| Start | Pause / menu |
| Back | Back / cancel depending on context |

> [!NOTE]
> Button names can differ between Android controllers.  
> If movement or looking feels wrong, open the in-game controls menu and reassign the affected controls.

## ▣ Game data notes

Game data is not bundled with this repository.

You need to provide your own legal copy of Unreal Tournament / UT99.  
The Android installer checks for the required folders:

```text
System
Maps
Textures
Sounds
Music
```

If these folders are missing, the game will not start and the installer screen will ask you to select a valid folder or ZIP file.
