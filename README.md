**Unreal Tournament Android** is an Android port of **Unreal Tournament / UT99 (1999)** based on the classic **Unreal Engine 1** source code.

The goal of this project is to make the original Unreal Tournament playable on Android devices, including legacy Android hardware such as the **OUYA console**, while preserving the classic look and feel of the PC version.

Original Unreal Tournament game data is **not included**.  
You need a valid PC installation of Unreal Tournament / UT99 and must import your own game data.
